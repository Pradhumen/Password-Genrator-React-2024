Site url: https://astounding-gingersnap-4f9f76.netlify.app/

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Password-Genrator-React-2024
A dynamic password generator built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS. The app allows users to customize password length, include numbers and special characters, and generate secure passwords with a click of a button. The password can be copied to the clipboard, and the design is responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.
